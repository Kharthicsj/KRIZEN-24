              Showcasing groundbreaking concepts, this event highlights the
              inventive presentations of participants, driving curiosity and
              enhancing expertise in the technical domain. The main aim of this
              event is to enhance the participant's ability in writing or making
              papers as well as to present it, and also to broaden the mind of
              the participants. And to encourage their desire to enhance their
              knowledge towards technical aspects. A paper presentation is an
              idea by itself.
